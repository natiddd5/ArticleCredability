When asked why they were considering canceling the game, a spokesman for the UF Athletic Department stated, "Though both programs are struggling this year, dealing with injuries and academic disciplinary action, there is no need in embarrassing the UF Athletic program further by subjecting our already mediocre team to a game that would further humiliate the morale and enthusiasm of our student body."
If in fact this game is cancelled it would be a disappointment to fans and alumni alike. We will keep you updated on any potential developments.

                     3 whale spotted in illinois river A humpback whale was spotted near Morris IL in the Illinois River today.  The sighting comes just days after 2 Great White Sharks were seen frolicking in the same area.  While not impossible, it does seem unlikely.  It is thought that the whale may have followed the sharks as they sometimes do in the wild.  The whale would of had to travel over 1250 miles to get to this location.  The Marine Biologist Association will be in town for a full investigation.  Until we have answers, we are asking folks to keep their pontoons and fishing boats docked.
                     4 two great white sharks found swimming in mississippi river near saint louis, missouri. While it is not entirely impossible, it is incredibly uncommon for salt water dwelling creatures to stay for lengthy periods of time in fresh water. However, two Great White Sharks have managed to survive the trip and make their way up the Mississippi River somehow. Believed to have started as a mating couple, the two are assumed to have swam the 920 mile journey from the mouth of the Mississippi River that is connected to the Gulf Of Mexico. Officials in Saint Louis have contacted the Missouri Conservation Department and will likely have a team in the river soon to capture the two lost sharks.
