 Donald Trump took a major step toward securing the Republican presidential nomination following the mogul’s Super Tuesday victory, and faced with the prospect of a President Trump, Miley Cyrus turned to Instagram Tuesday to tell her 38.1 million followers, “Donald Trump is a fucking nightmare!” Cyrus wrote the caption next to a publicity photo of Trump; Cyrus’ Instagram burn has gained 239,000 likes since it was posted Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Dead Petz singer continued lobbying against the GOP frontrunner with a photo of Trump’s delegate totals over Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and a caption where Cyrus playfully threatened to move out of the country if Trump is elected and a hashtag #aintapartyindausaanymo.

 Cyrus’ Instagram then took aim at self-proclaimed “most hated woman in the world” Rebecca Francis, a woman who uses her social media to showcase her hunting prowess, and the hunter’s allegiance to Trump.  Yes . That is a tear rolling down my cheek dripping off the end of my nose….. This makes me so unbelievable scared and sad…. Not only for our country but for animals that I love more than anything in this world…. My heart is broken into a 100000 pieces ….. I think I may vomit …. That picture on the right is so disturbing…. YOU are not destiny! It is not your job to decide when a living things life is over …. & YOU DT ARE NOT GOD NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU THINK YOU ARE!!! (& if he doesn’t think he is “God” he thinks he is the fucking chosen one or some shit! We’re all just fucking jam between his rich ass toes! Honestly fuck this shit I am moving if this is my president! I don’t say things I don’t mean! ) A photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Mar 2, 2016 at 6:07am PST 

 Cyrus isn’t the only artist to lament a possible future with Trump as commander in chief: Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Flea recently told Rolling Stone, “I can’t take Donald Trump or anything he says seriously. I just think that he’s a silly reality-show bozo and blustering guy who likes getting attention. I don’t think he wants to be president, and I don’t think he has a chance to be the president. He’s just some egotistical, silly person whose main concern in life is getting a blowjob. He wants to be on TV and he wants everyone to thinks he’s important.” We want to hear it.
