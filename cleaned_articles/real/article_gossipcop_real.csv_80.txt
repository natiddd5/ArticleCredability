Born Melania Knavs, she began her modelling career at the age of sixteen and attended the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia where she studied architecture. However, she left her studies after a year to pursue a successful career in modelling. Melania has worked as a fashion model for agencies in Milan and Paris and she later moved to New York City in 1996. In 2000, she appeared nude on the cover of British GQ, an achievement she is immensely proud of and is listed on her official biography on the White House website.  The website states: “As a model, Melania has appeared in high profile ad campaigns and worked with some of the top photographer in the fashion industry. “She has graced the covers of Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, British GQ, Ocean Drive, Avenue, In Style and New York Magazine.” Melania also once appeared scantily clad aboard Donald Trump’s gold-encrusted Boeing 727.
