Khloe Kardashian is baring it all as she nears the end of her pregnancy. The 33-year-old reality star, who is expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, rocked black lingerie and cradled her bare baby bump in a new pic posted to Instagram on Wednesday, March 21. “📸 @sashasamsonova,” she captioned the shot, tagging her glam squad. While it’s unclear exactly when the photo was taken, Kardashian revealed on January 2 that she was officially six months along. While she traveled to Japan at eight months pregnant late last month, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that the Revenge Body host is set to stay in Cleveland until she gives birth. (Thompson, 27, currently plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers).  Kardashian revealed on the March 4 episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians that she is expecting a baby girl.
