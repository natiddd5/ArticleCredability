 Right after the first leg of Linkin Park's One More Light World Tour, promoting their seventh studio album, One More Light, vocalist Chester Bennington was found dead from suicide by hanging on July 20, 2017, resulting in the cancellation of the rest of the tour.[2]
 On August 22, Linkin Park announced plans to host a tribute concert in Los Angeles to honor Bennington.[3] Later, the band confirmed that the concert would take place on October 27 at the Hollywood Bowl, and would feature a number of bands and musicians. On September 23, the band announced that the concert had officially sold out.
 On October 20, it was announced Linkin Park would livestream the concert on their YouTube channel.[4][5] As of July 2024, the concert has been viewed more than 25 million times.[6]
 The planned performance of "Castle of Glass" by No Doubt faced a change when lead vocalist Gwen Stefani withdrew two days before the event. Alanis Morissette, initially set to present her song "Rest," stepped in at the request of No Doubt members to replace Stefani. Morissette later expressed feeling nervous during the performance and frequently relied on the teleprompter.[14]
