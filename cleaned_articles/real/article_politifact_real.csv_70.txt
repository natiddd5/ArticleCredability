			giving  more than $200, as reported to the Federal Election Commission.  Individual contributions are generally categorized based
			on the  donor's occupation/employer, although individuals may be classified  instead as ideological donors if they've given more than
			$200 to an ideological PAC. NOTE: All the numbers on this page are for the 2008 election cycle and based on Federal Election Commission data released on

					Sunday, April 15, 2007.
