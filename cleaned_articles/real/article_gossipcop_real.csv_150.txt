arts entertainmentPop Culture  By Britton Peele 1:22 PM on Dec 1, 2017 CST Burleson's Kelly Clarkson won the Powerhouse Award at the Billboard Women in Music Awards ceremony Thursday night, but is hasn't been a perfect week for the music star. She told Extra that she had just been robbed. "Other than we got robbed last night," Clarkson said when Extra reporter Renee Bargh commented on how happy she looked. "We got here and our whole house was like bashed in, it was crazy." She's taking it in stride, though, noting that nothing irreplaceable was taken. "Materialistic things we didn't care about, the guy was in our kid's room ... so it was a little weird, other than that everyone is safe and good." Clarkson is also making waves this week for being in James Corden's hit Carpool Karaoke series of videos. The episode with Clarkson in it, posted Wednesday, already has more than 3.5 million views.
