					'Presumed Innocent' Episode 7 Recap: The Stand				 Guess what show is back? If you guessed Game of Thrones… you’re wrong! It’s Claws! Premiering last year, the TNT dramedy takes a look at the life and crimes of a group of women who work at a South Florida nail salon. Featuring an all-star cast that includes Emmy-nominated actress Niecy Nash, Carrie Preston, and Judy Reyes, this good women gone bad comedy is a fun mix of female friendship and organized crime. Decider’s own Joe Reid called Claws one of TV’s “most unpredictable dramas” that’s both “addictive and delightful.” When can you expect Season 2 of Claws to hit Hulu? Here’s everything you need to know! You can catch all new episodes of Claws on TNT. New episodes of Claws air Sunday nights at 9:00 p.m. Eastern on TNT. Yes! The first season of Claws is available to stream on Hulu. *** UPDATE: Claws Season 2 lands on Hulu on Sunday, May 12. *** No official release date for Season 2 of Claws dropping on Hulu has been announced, but we think we have a pretty good idea of when you can expect to see new episodes on the platform. The Season 1 finale of Claws aired August 13, 2017 on TNT, while all ten episodes of the first season of the hit dramedy premiered on Hulu on May 11, 2018. The Season 2 finale of Claws is scheduled to air on July 29th. If TNT and Hulu follow the same timetable as last year, we should expect to see Season 2 of Claws premiere on Hulu in April or May of 2019. While you wait for new episodes to drop on Hulu, Season 2 episodes of Claws are available to stream on TNT’s website. Decider reached out to Hulu for comment and will update this story as it develops. Where to stream Claws
