 The Pirates Of The Caribbean: Curse Of The Black Pearl is leaving Netflix in December.  A whole bunch of content is leaving Netflix in December including, oddly enough, some Christmas content (the very first title in the list below is 1991's All I Want For Christmas.) If you're in the middle of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia you'll definitely want to binge faster. Every season of that show is leaving Netflix next month. The Man From Snow River, an excellent Australian film with some of the best horse-riding cinematography out there, is also riding off into the sunset (we just watched this and the kids loved it. I watched it as a kid many times.) See what's coming to Netflix in December, and what to watch, here. Holes, Nightcrawler and Lucky Number Slevin are also leaving and are all worth a viewing. And finally, toward the end of the month, the one truly good Pirates of the Caribbean---The Curse of the Black Pearl---will set sail never to be seen on Netflix again. (Soon, all Disney content will be gone from Netflix as it migrates to Disney's own subscription service.)
